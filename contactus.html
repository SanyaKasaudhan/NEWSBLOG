                                            the situation prevailing in the oil market as “extraordinary” but more or less ruled out any fuel 
                                            price cuts in India despite the supply glut, stating that the Union government had taken a 
                                            “cautious and conscious” decision to use savings for welfare.
                                            “The oil industry is faced with an extraordinary situation. These are not normal times. Slippage
                                             of crude prices is coupled with disappearance of demand worldwide. The situation arose first because
                                              of the price wars between oil exporting nations. Earlier, the oil producing countries could resolve 
                                              their differences and reduce production, then COVID-19 struck. Due to the lockdowns in major economies, 
                                              the demand dried up. There were no takers for the crude being produced, the world literally ran out of 
                                              storage space for the crude and petroleum products,” the Minister said.

                                            the State Forest department on Tuesday formed rapid response teams to ensure that tigers from

                                            Chief Wildlife Warden Ravi Kant Sinha said a control room had been set up at Gosaba in the district to 
                                            monitor the situation in the mangrove jungles 24x7.

                                            The department’s central control room in the Salt Lake area will be in constant touch with the 
                                            Gosaba unit and keep a close watch on wildlife movement in the forest.

                                            “If there are attempts by tigers to stray from the core reserve area into the contiguous villages, 
                                            we will be able to notice that from the two control rooms and our rapid response teams will take 
                                            steps to send back the animal to its habitat,” he explained.

                                                The Brexit campaign mastermind told reporters he had acted "reasonably and legally" when he drove across the country with his wife while she was suffering from the virus in early April.
                                                
                                                Britain was then recording hundreds of deaths daily and following strict lockdown rules requiring people with even the slightest symptoms to stay at home for at least a week.

                                                Chief Wildlife Warden Ravi Kant Sinha said a control room had been set up at Gosaba in the district to 
                                                monitor the situation in the mangrove jungles 24x7.
    
                                                The department’s central control room in the Salt Lake area will be in constant touch with the 
                                                Gosaba unit and keep a close watch on wildlife movement in the forest.
    
                                                “If there are attempts by tigers to stray from the core reserve area into the contiguous villages, 
                                                we will be able to notice that from the two control rooms and our rapid response teams will take 
                                                steps to send back the animal to its habitat,” he explained.

                                                    A notice issued by the Chinese Embassy in New Delhi on Monday said students, businessmen

                                                    Those who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 or had fever and cough symptoms within the past
