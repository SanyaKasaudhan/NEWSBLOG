                        The Boeing aircraft, carrying 189 passengers and six crew, attempted to land amidst heavy tailwinds and rain on the table-top runway. It failed to hold on the runway due to poor weather conditions, and skidded for more than 75 m.

                        Animal rights activists, celebrities, politicians and other citizens have raised concern over the treatment meted out to animals in the state and have demanded strict action against the culprits.

                        The pregnant elephant died in Palakkad district after she reportedly consumed a fruit that was stuffed with firecrackers. 
                        The resulting blast injured her mouth grievously. She could not eat thereafter. To relieve her pain and burning sensation, she entered a river, stood in the water with her mouth open, but succumbed to her injuries after a long struggle.
                        
                        Since then, the tragedy has hogged national headlines, while social media has seen an outpouring of grief and anger. 
                        But this buzz has also fuelled a disinformation campaign that suits communal politics.

                        <p class="d-none d-sm-block">The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) last week announced a cut of 40 basis points (bps) in repo rates to 4%. 
                            RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee has slashed the external benchmark rate by a total of 115 bps since the lockdown to combat covid-19 began.
                                According to experts, those who are servicing MCLR-based loans might have to wait for reduction in their interest rates.
                                 “The 40 basis points reduction in the repo rate is a welcome move. At a time when people and businesses are in need of funds, 
                                 the repo rate reduction and additional liquidity measures will facilitate an increased flow of funds at affordable rates. 
                                 With most new loans tied to the repo rates, there is much higher and faster transmission of the interest rates compared 
                                 with MCLR and base rate," said Adhil Shetty, founder and CEO of BankBazaar.</p>

                        <p class="d-none d-sm-block"> The announcement Tuesday by Russian President Vladimir Putin that his country was the first to approve a coronavirus vaccine did not provoke the awe and wonder of the Soviet Union’s launch of the first satellite into orbit in 1957. Instead it was met by doubts about the science and safety.

                            But it also underscored how, like the space race, the competition to have the first vaccine is about international rivalries as well as science. The first nation to develop a way to defeat the novel coronavirus will achieve a kind of moonshot victory and the global status that goes along with it.
                            That’s valuable to Putin, whose popularity at home has declined amid a stagnant economy and the ravages of the virus outbreak.
                            “To be the first one out of the block with a coronavirus vaccine would be a real — pardon the pun — shot in the arm for the Kremlin,” said Timothy Frye, a political science professor at Columbia University who specializes in post-Soviet politics.

                        <p class="d-none d-sm-block"> For nearly a week, Mona Zahran had to sleep on a couch pulled across her apartment’s front door. Beirut’s massive explosion knocked her doors off their hinges and shattered her windows, and she feared looters would take advantage of the chaos that has hit the Lebanese capital since.

                            It was the latest and probably most humiliating blow in the turbulent life of the 50-year-old.
                            
                            A few months ago, Zahran lost her last income as a seamstress because of the combination of anti-government protests, Lebanon’s economic collapse and coronavirus restrictions.
                            Through past political instability, Lebanese always somehow kept their way of life unshaken. This time, it seems to have been wiped away. Over the last 10 months, Lebanese have had to deal with a dizzying series of events that have upended an artificial sense of security.

                            Ardern said Auckland, the nation’s largest city, will be moved to Alert Level 3 from midday Wednesday through midnight Friday, meaning that people will be asked to stay at home, while bars and many other businesses will be closed.
                            
                            “These three days will give us time to assess the situation, gather information, make sure we have widespread contact tracing so we can find out more about how this case arose and make decisions about how to respond to it once we have further information,” Ardern said at a hastily called news conference late Tuesday.

                            coronavirus pandemic, defending their government’s actions and saying that China had provided information in a timely and transparent manner.

                            China “wasted no time” in sharing information such as the genome sequence for the new virus with the World Health Organization as well as 
                            relevant countries and regional organizations, according to the report.
                            
                            An Associated Press investigation found that government labs sat on releasing the genetic map of the virus for more than a week in January,

                            northern New South Wales state on Sunday, officials said.

                            The man received a bite to the back of his thigh and was brought to the shore by other surfers who had fought off the shark, a surf rescue group, 
                            Surf Life Saving NSW, said in a statement. The victim, from Tugun just over the state border in Queensland, received first aid on the shore but died on the beach.
                            
                            “A shark biologist assessed photographs and confirmed a white shark was responsible for the fatal attack,” the state’s Department of Primary Industries said.
                            “When you get a call to attend a shark attack, you never really know the full extent of the damage until you get on scene,” he said. “They did everything they could 
                            to try and save his life, but despite their best efforts, were unable to do so.”</p>

                            His family said Yokota died of natural causes in a hospital in Kawasaki, near Tokyo, on Friday, before he was able to meet his daughter again.
                            
                            “My husband and I did our best together, but he passed before seeing Megumi again. Now I’m at a loss,” his wife Sakie, 84, said in a statement.
                            
                            Megumi disappeared in 1977 on her way home from her a junior high school in Niigata on Japan’s northern coast when she was 13. It was the day after she gave her father a comb as a birthday gift, a memento he always carried with him.
                            A former Central Bank official, Yokota, and his wife kept looking for Megumi and found out 20 years later that she had been abducted to North Korea by its agents.

                            the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said both the countries have agreed to peacefully resolve the situation in the border areas.

                            The external affairs ministry also said the military talks on Saturday between India and China took place in cordial and peaceful atmosphere.
                            
                            In an official statement released on Sunday, the MEA said that India and China have agreed to resolve the standoff in accordance with various bilateral agreements. 
                            It also mentioned that peace and tranquility in the border areas is essential for the development of bilateral relations.
                            
                            The MEA said, "In recent weeks, India and China have maintained communications through established diplomatic and military channels to address the situation in areas along the India-China border."
                            In the meeting, India and China also agreed that an early resolution would contribute to the further development of the relationship between the two countries. 
                            This came in view of the 0th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries.

                            The move came after two French advisory bodies and the World Health Organization warned this week that the drug --

                        India’s factory output contracted sharply for the fourth straight month in June, though at a slower pace than in May, signalling the gradual normalisation of manufacturing activity; however, localised lockdowns to curb the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic could hamper the process of economic recovery.

                        Data released by the National Statistical Office on Tuesday showed the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) contracted 16.6% in June against a 34% contraction in May.

                        During the June quarter, IIP contracted 35.3%, which may heavily weigh on GDP growth for that quarter, data for which is scheduled to be released by end August.

                        In June, manufacturing activity improved the sharpest, with the output shrinkage at 17.1% against the 38.4% contraction in May, while the contraction in mining (19.8%) and electricity (10%) sectors showed little improvement.

                        Investor sentiment in Germany improved more than expected in August, the ZEW economic research institute said on Tuesday, cautioning, however, that experts see current conditions improving only slowly.

                        The survey of investors’ economic sentiment rose to 71.5 from 59.3 points the previous month, far exceeding a forecast for 58.0 in a Reuters poll of economists.

                        “Hopes for a speedy economic recovery have continued to grow, but the assessment of the situation is improving only slowly,” said ZEW President Achim Wambach, adding the situation varied from sector to sector.

                        A separate gauge of current conditions dropped to -81.3 points from -80.9 the previous month. That compared with a consensus forecast of -68.8 points.

                            Responding to questions about how 'Made in India' can replace 'Made in China', Uday Kotak said that he has complete confidence 
                            in the Government of India's push for "Aatmanirbhar Bharat". President of CII and MD of Kotak Mahindra Bank, Uday Kotak told India Today, 
                            "India should shed risk aversion, and think about this as an opportunity to build in India and make in India."
                            "There is a significant geo-political issue which is being played around in the world between China and the rest of the world and this is about 
                            excessive concentration and dependence on China as the factory of the world. Most global players now want a diversification beyond China," Uday Kotak said.

                            (GI Council) on the feasibility of an insurance cover for dealing with retrenchment, sources privy to the matter have said. This comes in the wake of a large 
                            number of salaried individuals losing their jobs due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

                            In a recent letter to the prime minister, Union minister Nitin Gadkari had suggested the need for an insurance product that gives subsistence salary for a 
                            limited period of time in case of job loss due to technological advancement, an act of nature, or change in the economic structure.
                            
                            The Prime Minister's Office forwarded the letter to the Department of Financial Services (DFS) which has, in turn, sought suggestions from Irdai and GI Council.
                            Sources said, "It will be like life cover, personal accident cover and cover for loss of income. In case you are fired, six months payment will be covered."

                        In a letter to employees which he later posted on Facebook, Zuckerberg acknowledged that his decision to not take action against Trump’s 
                        “When the looting starts, shooting starts’ post left his employees enraged. “The decision I made last week has left many of you angry,

                    <p class="d-none d-sm-block">OnePlus has made a name for itself for offering high-end specifications at relatively affordable prices, with the recent 
                        OnePlus 8 series phones reminding that. The company has, however, focused on getting the user experience just right for Android enthusiasts in many ways,
                         with one of them including timely updates. OnePlus is also one of the few brands supporting older phones with the latest software. Case in point is the OnePlus 5
                          series and it’s Android 10 update.

                        Last year, while OnePlus was competing with Google for releasing Android 10 on its OnePlus 7 series, it also promised the update for its 2017-flagship models, 
                        which is the OnePlus 5 series. A timely update for the three-year-old phone wasn’t promised but OnePlus did say it is going to release Android 10 for those phones. 
                        It now seems that OnePlus is almost done delivering on its promise.
                        
                        OnePlus has just put up the Android 10-based build of Oxygen OS under beta testing for the OnePlus 5 and OnePlus 5T. This is the Open Beta for Oxygen OS, 
                        which means if you are still rocking a OnePlus 5 or OnePlus 5T and want to move to the latest version of Android now, you can go ahead and download. You will have 
                        to download the ROM manually and install it on the device.
                        
                        However, you should know that this is still under beta and that means it’s bound to have a few bugs as well as irregularities. Hence, you should be ready 
                        to face issues, if any exists. It is suggested you should only get the Open Beta if you don’t use the phone as your primary device.

                        These security cameras have today become an integral part of most of the houses in India. The companies keep making these cameras smarter
                         by pushing new updates on them. The camera quality has also come a long way for these security cams. These have also become relatively cheaper of late.

                    <p class="d-none d-sm-block">The Motorola Razr is a popular smartphone in 2020 but not many of us have it in our pockets. With its price of Rs 1,24,999, 
                        it is safe to say that the only the well-heeled may go for it. Nonetheless, it’s desirability factor is high and we can only hope that its future iterations 
                        become more affordable. For the current model though, Motorola has released the Android 10 update and given its log sheet, it seems that the update has made 
                        the Razr more useful (and may we say desirable).

                        When Motorola launched the Razr internationally last November, the phone shipped with Android 9 Pie. This was surprising, given that Android 10 had been already 
                        out three months. Motorola did say that the Razr will get the update to Android 10 later, which has happened now. It may have been late but Motorola has brought
                         a lot of new features to make the Razr more appealing.
                        
                        As usual, the Razr gets all the Android 10 goodies such as the enhanced privacy features, the new dark mode, gesture navigation system, and more. However, similar 
                        to the Motorola Edge+, the Razr also gets the MyUX feature that allows a lot more customisations to the UI than before. One can change icon colours, shapes and more.
