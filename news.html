                            RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee has slashed the external benchmark rate by a total of 115 bps since the lockdown to combat covid-19 began.

                            a controversial and potentially harmful drug that US President Donald Trump has said he is taking preventively.
                            The move came after two French advisory bodies and the World Health Organization warned this week that the drug -- 
                            a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis and lupus -- had been shown to be potentially dangerous in several studies.
                            
                            The urgency of the coronavirus outbreak has prompted some doctors to prescribe the drug despite a lack of research to 
                            demonstrate its efficacy against the novel coronavirus.</p>

                        <p class="d-none d-sm-block">The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) last week announced a cut of 40 basis points (bps) in repo rates to 4%. 
                            RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee has slashed the external benchmark rate by a total of 115 bps since the lockdown to combat covid-19 began.
                                According to experts, those who are servicing MCLR-based loans might have to wait for reduction in their interest rates.
                                 “The 40 basis points reduction in the repo rate is a welcome move. At a time when people and businesses are in need of funds, 
                                 the repo rate reduction and additional liquidity measures will facilitate an increased flow of funds at affordable rates. 
                                 With most new loans tied to the repo rates, there is much higher and faster transmission of the interest rates compared 
                                 with MCLR and base rate," said Adhil Shetty, founder and CEO of BankBazaar.</p>
