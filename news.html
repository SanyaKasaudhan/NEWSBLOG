                            the state government had requested Ministry of Civil Aviation to defer resumption of flights from Kolkata airport.
                            Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Saturday said West Bengal will urge the Centre to postpone resuming domestic flight 
                            services at Kolkata and Bagdogra airports by a few days as the state will be busy with managing the damage caused by Cyclone Amphan.

                            water for more than five days, civic authorities in several affected areas have employed the labourers and electricians for restoration 
                            work.

                        <p class="d-none d-sm-block">The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) last week announced a cut of 40 basis points (bps) in repo rates to 4%. 
                            RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee has slashed the external benchmark rate by a total of 115 bps since the lockdown to combat covid-19 began.
                                According to experts, those who are servicing MCLR-based loans might have to wait for reduction in their interest rates.
                                 “The 40 basis points reduction in the repo rate is a welcome move. At a time when people and businesses are in need of funds, 
                                 the repo rate reduction and additional liquidity measures will facilitate an increased flow of funds at affordable rates. 
                                 With most new loans tied to the repo rates, there is much higher and faster transmission of the interest rates compared 
                                 with MCLR and base rate," said Adhil Shetty, founder and CEO of BankBazaar.</p>

                        <p class="d-none d-sm-block">Paris: The French government on Wednesday banned treatment of COVID-19 patients with hydroxychloroquine, 
                            a controversial and potentially harmful drug that US President Donald Trump has said he is taking preventively.
                            The move came after two French advisory bodies and the World Health Organization warned this week that the drug -- 
                            a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis and lupus -- had been shown to be potentially dangerous in several studies.
                            
                            The urgency of the coronavirus outbreak has prompted some doctors to prescribe the drug despite a lack of research to 
                            demonstrate its efficacy against the novel coronavirus.</p>

                            All educational institutions were ordered shut by the Government of India on March 16 due to rising cases of coronavirus infections. 
                            The ensuing nationwide lockdown has affected the academic calendars of all educational institutions in an unprecedented manner.
